 # Not in scope, but important
 * Transactions
 * Stored Procedures
 * Aggregating data
	 * MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT with GROUP BY
	 * HAVING
	 * DISTINCT

# Scenario
We're in the early stage of developing a new product called 'partygoers'. We'll be getting some requirements one-by-one, and want to ensure that our SQL database technology of choice is up to the task (hint: it will be :D)

# Setup

First, a VERY quick pre-amble on databases:

Two key players:
* The engine (a.k.a. the server)
	* Usually hosted on dedicated hardware when running in production
	* In test environments, you'll see some running on shared hardware, some on their own hardware
	* When used for local development, any of
		* Shared server for all devs (EUGH - n.b. there are horror stories of devs devving against PROD!)
		* Server running locally on dev's machines (Isolated - Nice!)
* Clients (a.k.a. connections)
	* Sends SQL (query) (DDL, DML) to the server
	* May receive data, or just a success/failure response
	* Apps connect to a DB, submits SQL via code e.g.
		* ![[Pasted image 20241216220332.png]]
	* Humans connect to the DB, usually by using a client then hand-crafting queries
		* ![[Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 22.51.35.png]]

Today we are going to focus on hand-crafting SQL, just to avoid the complexities (that aren't THAT complex) of connecting to a server via code.

* Normally would have to somehow
	* Download the postgres program onto PC https://www.postgresql.org/download/
	* Figure out how to start it... https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-start.html
* But for ease of setup we will use Docker

1. Install docker https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

2. pull the postgres image (container with the postgres engine installed so we don't have to manually install it)
```
docker pull postgres
```

If this is successful, you can run `docker images ls` and see a line for 'postgres'
3. Run the image to start postgres
```bash
docker runÂ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```
If this is successful, you can run `docker ps` and see a line for postgres...
... then connect from your tool of choice (e.g. PGAdmin)

Host name/address: localhost
Port: 5432
Username: postgres
Password: password

Remember we're creating a new product, so creating a new database is probably a good idea.

# Requirements

Each requirement will be in the form of an english statement, we will aim to write the SQL to solve the problem. There may be many ways to solve each requirement (perhaps multiple options for the SQL or table design). E.g (for a fictitious payments processor):

1. I have a list of payments from a third party that I want to store to use later e.g:
amount: 1.23, payment_initiated_at: '2024-12-17 00:55:52', payment_confirmed_at: '2024-12-17 00:55:53'
amount: 2.34, payment_initiated_at: '2024-12-17 00:55:52', payment_confirmed_at: NULL
Answer:
```sql
insert into payments
(
	amount,
	payment_initited_at,
	payment_confirmed_at
)
SELECT	1.23, '2024-12-17 00:55:52'::timestamp, '2024-12-17 00:55:53'::timestamp
UNION
SELECT	2.34, '2024-12-17 00:55:52'::timestamp, NULL

-- OR

insert into payments
(
	amount,
	payment_initited_at,
	payment_confirmed_at
)
VALUES
(1.23, '2024-12-17 00:55:52'::timestamp, '2024-12-17 00:55:53'::timestamp),
(2.34, '2024-12-17 00:55:52'::timestamp, NULL)
```
2. I want to see a list of all the payments that have been completed in the last 24 hrs

```sql
select	*
from	payments
where	payment_confirmed_at > now() - INTERVAL '1 DAY'
```
